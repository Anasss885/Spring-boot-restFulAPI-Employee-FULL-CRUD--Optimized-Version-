# Spring-boot-restFulAPI-Employee-FULL-CRUD--Optimized-Version-
A Spring Boot application that exposes a fully functional RESTful API for managing Employee data using Spring Data JPA and Spring Data REST. Supports automatic CRUD endpoints, entity management, and seamless integration with a relational database (MySQL) , using Low Code methodolgies like Spring Data JPA and Spring Data REST helps me to didn't have a concrete implementation to the any of 3 layers(controller,Service,DAO)
by handling DAO by Spring Data JPA and remove delegation calls from service and handle main CRUD endpoints using Spring Data REST so i implmenet this project 2 times , the first within a concrete implmenetaion to all layers and last time here with a fair implementation depending on Low-code methedology .
